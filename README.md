# WhatsApp Bot Project with Persistent Authentication

This project implements a WhatsApp bot using the `whatsapp-web.js` library, focusing on maintaining the user's session active between server restarts, thus eliminating the need to repeatedly scan the QR Code. The bot is capable of responding to simple messages and can be expanded to meet various automation and interaction needs via WhatsApp.
